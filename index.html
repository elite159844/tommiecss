        <h1 style="text-align:left">2022</h1>

        <p style="text-align:left">2022 was a wild year for Rockstar Games and the GTA Community. On Febuary 5th, 2022, GTA VI was confirmed to be in active development, a lot of people were excited including myself. On September, 18th, 2022, Grand Theft Auto VI got leaked. Tons of footage of GTA VI in its early alpha state was posted online and quickly spread online. At first, i was skeptical and wasn't sure if the footage I seen was actually GTA VI. Some time has passed and people who were posting the leaked footage were getting their account deleted and the footage would get taken down, proving the footage was real.</p>
        
        <p style="text-align:left">Eventually Rockstar Games would make a statement about the leaked footage. Some people thought the game would be delayed but Rockstar Games stated that this would not effect the game's development at all. Nobody expected this huge leak to happen, it just came out of nowhere. Around 90 Clips were leaked.</p>

        <p style="text-align:left">The Grand Theft Auto VI leaks were the biggest leaks in gaming history.</p>
    

        <h1 style="text-align:left">2023</h1>

        <p style="text-align:left">This year was something special. Many people would make crazy theories on when GTA VI is gonna get its first trailer. People would predict when the trailer would come out. One of the craziest theories was the moon theory, people would use that theory to predict the release date of the first trailer. People were desperate for GTA VI news.</p>
        <p style="text-align:left">On November 8th, 2023, Rockstar Games would announce that the first trailer for GTA VI would be released in early December. Lots of people went crazy once this was posted. GTA VI like always would be #1 Trending On Twitter/X. When it was finally December, Rockstar Games would post a GTA VI teaser picture showing the release data and time of when the GTA VI trailer would come out.</p>
        <p style="text-align:left">On December 4th, the trailer would end up releasing earlier then expected. What happened was that because Rockstar Games Premiered the trailer on Youtube, somebody was able to access the video and posted a low quality verison of the trailer online. Rockstar Games would end up releasing the trailer early because of this leak. GTA VI Trailer 1 would gain a ton of views and likes, it would break records. 
       
        <p style="text-align:left">𝗔𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝗗𝗲𝗰𝗲𝗺𝗯𝗲𝗿 𝟮𝟮, 𝟮𝟬𝟮𝟰, 𝗚𝗧𝗔 𝗩𝗜 𝗧𝗿𝗮𝗶𝗹𝗲𝗿 𝟭 𝗵𝗮𝘀 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗰𝗵𝗲𝗱 𝟮𝟮𝟳 𝗺𝗶𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄𝘀.</p>

        <h1 style="text-align:left">2024</h1>

        <p style="text-align:left">This year has been extremely quiet and dry. Rockstar Games hasen't gave any update on GTA VI, no new info, no trailer, nothing. But, there is a new theory that suggests Trailer 2 could come out on December 27th. The theory is the 27 theory, there is tons of 27 references and good evidence that possibly trailer 2 could release on the 27th after christmas. Some people are split, half are saying nothing is happening, the other half says something will happen.</p>
        <p style="text-align:left">Personally I think its a 50/50 we get something on the 27th. GTA VI Is set to release In Fall 2025 on the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. GTA VI is the most anticipated game of all time, and I can't wait to play it. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJbtcbkErxk">𝗖𝗹𝗶𝗰𝗸 𝗛𝗲𝗿𝗲 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗺𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗶𝗻𝗳𝗼 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝟮𝟳 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗼𝗿𝘆</a></p>

        <h1 style="text-align:left">2025</h1>

        <p style="text-align:left">This is probaby the best year for GTA VI News and Updates. Trailer 2 released and it gave us a ton of info more then ever. The graphics were a huge leap from GTA V and RDR2.</p>
        <p style="text-align:left">The amount of detail shown in the trailer is crazy, the lighting, reflections and textures. Many of the characters shown in the trailer had a ton of details on the face and body. There is a pretty big difference when you compare Trailer 1 and Trailer 2. Before the release of Trailer 2, Rockstar Games made an annoucement regarding the game's release date, and unfortunately the game was delayed to May 26 2026.</p>
