        <h1 style="text-align:left">The Tips</h1>

        <p style="text-align:left">Use your perks around the 3rd round, don’t use them early. Study the board and try to get extra moves. Use your booster every time its available. This game requires some skill and reaction time. The biggest thing is studying the board for moves, make sure to do it even if its the opponents turn.</p>
        <p style="text-align:left">Games are also timed so you gotta make moves fast. To get extra moves you have to match 4. Basically any pieces that let you match more than 4 or more will give you an extra move, vertical, horizontal, etc. If pieces are both horizontal and vertical together, then it can create a bomb. Matching 5 can also create lightning I recommend to use the hammer perk to break it. Take advantage of this and you can win most of your games.</p>
        <p style="text-align:left">Don’t spend your coins early game. I recommend spending them until you reach around 1k trophies. Spend them on gold boosters when you unlock them.</p>

        <h1 style="text-align:left">Obtain More Coins</h1>

        <p style="text-align:left">Go to the free coins links or their facebook page to claim free coins/rewards. I usually would click on all links until it says link expired. You should have 1k-2k coins after doing this. Also when teams are unlocked, make sure to join them, you can request boosters and stickers. Stickers are also a great way to unlock boosters and coins.</p>
        <p style="text-align:left">𝗡𝗼𝘁𝗲: your not gonna win every game, some losses is fine.</p>
